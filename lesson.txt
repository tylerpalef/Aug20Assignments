Git Review:
What is Git? A Version Control System.
It only keeps track of additions and removal of lines of codes.

Commit etiquette:
Should always include a single sentence summarizing the change(s) you've made.
A commit is a snapshot of changes over time.

Git Tools in the Terminal:
git diff
- You can use git diff in terminal to see what changes were made prior to a commit.

git log
- Shows a list of all the commits

Branching:

git branch
- Shows you all the branches that exist on your repo
- You can also create a new branch (typically it is just one new feature)
- You can only look at one branch at a time.

git checkout "input the branch"
- You can switch between branches using the checkout command



Merging:

In-class Exercise:
Top half goes to one person, bottom half to the other person.
First fork it, add a collaborator
Then both clone the changes.

Should always merge a branch with the master on Github rather than locally
Add, Commit and Push your branch. Then in GitHub pull the origin master.
Then you can use a new pull and compare/add the changes.


Merge Conflicts:

The person who merges first has no problems

It is the second person who will have to deal with the conflict.
You will need to resolve conflicts before you can complete the change.
The Github text editor will show you the conflict (what is in master)
